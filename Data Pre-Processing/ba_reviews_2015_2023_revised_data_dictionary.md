# British Airways Reviews - Annotated Data Dictionary

## Introduction

British Airways, one of the world's leading airlines, has been synonymous with excellence and reliability for decades. With a rich history and a commitment to providing exceptional customer experiences, British Airways continues to be a preferred choice for travelers worldwide.

As part of a challenging and rewarding data science project at British Airways, I had the opportunity to work on web scraping review data from the renowned Skytrax website.
