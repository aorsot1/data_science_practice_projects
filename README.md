# Practice on Various Datasets
This repository hosts various data science-related items: notebooks, datasets, models, etc. Most datasets will be sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) but, there will be additional sources from UCL Machine Learning, web scraping, and API calls. The general workflow is sub-divided into 4 work stations with a designated tool, output and :

* Subflow 1: Mining
  - Tools: Python
  - Output: Raw dataset
    
* Subflow 2: Pre-Processing -> Analysis -> Visualization
  - Tools: Python, Tableau/PowerBI
  - Output: Clean Dataset, Notebook/Report, Dashboard
    
* Subflow 3: Databases
  - Tools: SQL
  - Output: Database
    
* Subflow 3: Machine Learning
  - Tools: Python
  - Output: Model
